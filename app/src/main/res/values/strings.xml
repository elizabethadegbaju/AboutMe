    <string name="bio">Each app that you create with Android Studio starts with a default launcher icon that represents the app.
        \nLauncher icons are sometimes called app icons or product icons.
        \nIf you publish an app on Google Play, the app\'s launcher icon appears in the app\'s listing and search results in the Google Play store.
        \nAfter an app is installed on an Android-powered device, the app\'s launcher icon appears on the device\'s home screen and elsewhere on the device.
        \nFor example, the Android Sunflower app\'s launcher icon appears in the device\'s Search Apps window, shown as 1 in the screenshot below.
        \nThe default launcher icon, shown as 2 below, is used initially for all app projects that you create in Android Studio.
        \nExperiment with adding an ImageView above the TextView inside the ScrollView.
        \nWhen you run the app, this image, unlike the star, will scroll out of view as the text scrolls up.
